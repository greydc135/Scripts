# Overview
I had so much fun making the beginning part of this game. I am going to keep working on it independently
and see where I go from there! I didn't know if it would make sense to put the actual Unity files for the
Animations, Graphics, Prefabs(clonable items), and Scenes here would make sense, so I didn't.

# Animations
The animating was the most difficult thing, actually! I had to look up multiple tutorials to get the
character to do what I wanted him to. What the Animation folder actually contains is animation trees
that follow different paths depending on the state the Player is in.

# Graphics
By far, graphics took the longest. I truly enjoyed making successful sprites, but it took a long time.

# Development Environment
  * VS Code
  * Git
  * C#
  * Aseprite
  * Unity

# New Knowledge
I am so excited! I'm finally doing what I want to do when I grow up! Even if I don't sell the games
I make for very much, I want to do my best, and I'll be proud of what I make. Of all the things I
learned in Unity, I know the least about Scenes. Hopefully I get more knowledge soon!

Thanks for a great semester! :D
